# Scientific Calculator

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based **Scientific Calculator** that supports both basic arithmetic operations and advanced mathematical computations. Designed for ease of use, it provides a terminal-based interface that allows users to perform various calculations efficiently.

## Features
- **Core Functionalities**:
  - Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
  - Advanced mathematical functions: Square root, power, logarithms (natural and base-10).
  - Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) and their inverses.
  - Hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh).
  - Factorial, permutation, and combination calculations.

- **Additional Features**:
  - Support for radians and degrees in trigonometric calculations.
  - Adjustable precision for results (e.g., 2, 4, or 8 decimal places).
  - Ability to chain multiple operations in a single input.
  - Calculation history logging.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wajoel/ScientificCalculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ScientificCalculator
   ```
3. Run the calculator:
   ```bash
   python scientific_calculator.py
   ```

## Usage Instructions
- Enter mathematical expressions directly, e.g., `sin(45) + log10(100)`.
- Use `history` to view past calculations.
- Use `exit` to quit the calculator.
- When prompted, specify the desired precision for results (default is 4 decimal places).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries: `math`, `sympy`
